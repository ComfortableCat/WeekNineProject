Reflection
I achieved the basic requirements and some stretch goals. however I dont have expected basic functionality of writting comments on posts but I can create new topics
I couldnt include likes or follows and followee and i failed to add a check for empty bio
Adding clerk so I could add the id to the database in a sensible way. I hoped I could add it on signin which i couldnt do so i worked around and added on page refresh if signed in which works similarly as its in the head which above the different pages of the site. I found it difficult for everything I think I was very burnt out during the week and failed to focus and learn. this has really scared and shaken me and makes me worry about a career in this area as if I burn out after 9 weeks how will I manage in the job.

I did manage to refind drive and got the project to a point of submission and I feel I could take it further with more time. (I am still really enjoying coding)
